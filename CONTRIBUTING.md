The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Hub23, the Alan Turing Institute's private BinderHub instance.
These are mostly guidelines, not rules.

### :zap: Hub23

Hub23 is a [BinderHub](https://binderhub.readthedocs.io) instance.
BinderHub is computational infrastructure that makes sharing reproducible computational environments and analyses in the cloud as simple as clicking a link in your browser.
Sarah has given [many talks](https://sgibson91.github.io/speaking/) on what Binder/BinderHub/[mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org) is and how it works, so for the sake of brevity we'll just focus on Hub23 here.

Hub23 was set up to provide members of the Turing with an alternative to the public BinderHub, [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org), which allows for authenticating users.
Eventually we also hope to support, private code repositories and datasets.

Hub23 got it's name as a derivative of the [Research Engineering team's](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/research-engineering) nickname Hut23, which derives from the [hut that housed the engineering team at Bletchley Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bletchley_Park#Huts) during World War Two.
This, of course, was where Alan Turing and his team cracked the German Enigma code.
