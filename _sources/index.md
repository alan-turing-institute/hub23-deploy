# Hub23 Deployment Guide

This site hosts documentation around deploying, maintaining and customising the Hub23 BinderHub instance.

```{warning}
Since Hub23 now shares the same Kubernetes infrastructure as the Turing Federation BinderHub, the docs discussing how to deploy/change/remove Kubernetes clusters are only here for clarity and should not be acted upon without first notifying the mybinder.org operating team and removing the Turing's BinderHub from the Federation.
