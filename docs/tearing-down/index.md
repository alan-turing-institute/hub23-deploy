# Tearing Down BinderHub

This section will guide you through the steps required to remove a BinderHub deployment once you are done with it.

```{warning}
Since Hub23 now shares the same Kubernetes infrastructure as the Turing Federation BinderHub, these docs are only here for clarity and should not be acted upon without first notifying the mybinder.org operating team and removing the Turing's BinderHub from the Federation.
